# Analysis of North Carolina Power Plants and Environmental Justice Communities

This project aims to analyze electricity generation in North Carolina, with a specific interest in solar generation and impact on Environmental Justice communities.

## Summary
The researchers' interest in Energy and Environmental Justice motivated the topic of this project. Specifically, the goal is to understand how power generation impacts Environmental Justice communities. Since solar power is a robust renewable energy source in North Carolina, solar power plants will also be a focus in this investigation.

This analysis plans to address the following research questions:

1. What is the distribution and capacity of power plants generating electricity in North Carolina?
2. Does electricity generation impact air quality through criteria air pollutant emissions in North Carolina?
3. What are the Environmental Justice implications of electricity power generation in North Carolina? Are power plants primarily located in low-income and disadvantaged communities?

## Keywords
Solar Power, North Carolina, Environmental Justice Communities, Electricity Generation

## Database Information
EGRID 2022: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency publishes data on the status of electricity generation, the location of power plants, and generator fuel types each year. This data set describes electricity generation in the United States as of 2022. https://www.epa.gov/egrid/download-data

## Folder structure, file formats, and naming conventions
This repository contains a folder with the relevant data, including Raw, Processed and Spatial. The Data Wrangling and Processing RMD file depicts how the raw data sets were compiled for the analysis.

## Metadata
<For each data file in the repository, describe the data contained in each column.
Include the column name, a description of the information, the class of data, and
any units associated with the data. Create a list or table for each data file.>



## Scripts and code
The repository also contains a Data Wrangling and Processing RMD file, which contains the code to write the processed data sets. The Data Wrangling file showcases which worksheets in the EGRID 2022 data set were utilized in this analysis.

The individual analyses folder contains three RMD files which were initial explorations by members on the research team, and one blank example of the final project template. Each researcher analyzed one of the three research questions in an individual RMD file, before compiling into the final product.
