# Analysis of North Carolina Power Plants and Environmental Justice Communities

This project aims to analyze electricity generation in North Carolina, with a specific interest in solar generation and impact on Environmental Justice communities.

## Summary
The researchers interest in Energy and Environmental Justice motivated the topic of this project. Specifically, the goal is to understand how power generation impacts Environmental Justice communities. Since solar power is a robust renewable energy source in North Carolina, solar power plants will also be a focus in this investigation.

This analysis plans to address the following research questions:

1. What is the distribution and capacity of Solar Power Plants in North Carolina?
2. How does the fuel type of a power plant impact the carbon dioxide equivalent emissions by county in North Carolina?
3. What are the Environmental Justice implications of electricity power generation in North Carolina?
4. Are power plants primarily located in low-income and disadvantaged communities?
